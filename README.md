# TSP-Solver
## Specification
Solving the traveling salesman problem using Simulated Annealing. The output of the algorithm is represented by the SFML graphical library. The solver is implemented in src/TSPsolver.cpp and include/TSPsolver.h. The nodes are stored with x,y coordinates and can be added to the solver with the addNode function. The solve function is used to run the algorithm. The getNodes function returns the nodes as std::vectors.
